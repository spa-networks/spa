Authors of SPA

Jean-Gabriel Young implemented this simulation of the SPA (Structural 
Preferential Attachment) stochastic process.

The SPA process is introduced in :

  "Structural preferential attachment: 
     Network organization beyond the link"
  L. Hébert-Dufresne, A. Allard, V. Marceau, P.-A. Noël, and L.J. Dubé
  Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 158702, (2011)
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5980

and the community structure it creates is studied extensively in :

  "Structural preferential attachment: 
     Stochastic process for the growth of scale-free, 
     modular and self-similar systems"
   L. Hébert-Dufresne, A. Allard, V. Marceau, P.-A. Noël, and L.J. Dubé
   Phys. Rev. E 85, 026108, (2012)
   http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0034

A local extension that incorporates an explicit link creation mechanism 
is presented in  :
   
  "Structural preferential attachment of community structure 
     and its relation to Dunbar’s number"
  J.-G. Young, L. Hébert-Dufresne, A. Allard and L.J. Dubé

This C++11 simulation implements the complete version (all three 
publications).
